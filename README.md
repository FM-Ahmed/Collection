### check_prime.py 
Checks if some arbitrary input $n$ is a prime number or not. My take on this for fun, and likely not the most efficient. 

### prime_number.py
Checks if some arbitrary input $n$ is a prime number or not. Version 2 of checking if some input is a prime number.

### primes.py
Uses the function check_prime.py to list all the primes between $1$ and $n$. The length of the list is the amount of prime numbers between $1$ and $n$.

### fibonacci_sequence.py
Calculates the fibonacci sequence from $F_0$ to $F_n$.

### Example.py
An example of how the functions in primes.py was used to plot prime numbers in polar coordinates to find a spiralling pattern.
