import numpy as np
n = 11 # some arbitrary number you want to check, code might take a while if n is too large... Must be a whole number, i.e. an integer.
check_prime(n)
# returns '11 is a prime!'.
# if input n was not a prime number, e.g 12, it would return '12 is not a prime...'.

number_of_primes(n)
# returns 'There are 5 prime numbers between 1 and 11.'
