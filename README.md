### functions.py
Includes two functions: check_prime and primes. 
#### check_prime 
Checks if some arbitrary input n is a prime number or not. My take on this for fun, and likely not the most efficient. 

#### primes
Uses the function check_prime to list all the primes between 1 and n. The length of the list is the amount of prime numbers between 1 and n.

### Example.py
An example of how the functions in functions.py were used to plot prime numbers in polar coordinates to find a spiralling pattern.
