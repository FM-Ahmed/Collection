### functions.py
Includes two functions. First function check_prime checks if some arbitrary input n is a prime number or not. My take on this for fun, and likely not the most efficient. Second function number_of_primes uses the first function to check how many primes there are between 1 and n. 

### Example1.py
Brief example of how the functions work.
