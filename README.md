### functions.py
Includes two functions. First function check_prime checks if some arbitrary input n is a prime number or not. My take on this for fun, and likely not the most efficient. Second function primes uses the first function to list all the primes between 1 and n. The length of the list is the amount of prime numbers between 1 and n.

## Example.py
An example of how the functions in functions.py were used to plot prime numbers in polar coordinates to find a pretty pattern.
